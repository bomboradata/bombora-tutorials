    "## 0. Surge vs Interest?\n",
    "\n",
    "As a matter of clarification, *topic surge* as a product is generated from *topic interest* models. In technical discussions, we'll refer to both the product and the models by the latter, providing a conceptually more meaningful mapping. Bombora's user-facing topic interest scores (and the origin of the data you currently have) are currently generated from a 3rd party topic interest model and service. As mentioned previously, we are also are developing an internal topic interest model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. End User Datasets  (Overview)\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, down the topic interest line, there exists primarily three datasets that are consumed by end users (ordering from raw to aggregate):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Firehose** *(FH)*: the raw content consumption data, which contains event level resolution. Size is thousands of GBs/week, only a handful of clients actually consume this data. Bombora Data Science team refers to this as the *raw event data*.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **All Domains All Topic** *(ADAT)*: an aggregate topic interest score on keys of interest in the Firehose data. Size is tens of GBs/week. Bombora Data Science team refers to this as the *topic interest score data*. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Master Surge** *(MS)*: A filtering and transformation of the *ADAT* dataset to consider only those topic keys whose scores meet some *surge* score criteria (explained below). Size is GBs/week. Bombora Data Science team refer to this as *surging topic interest score data*.\n",
    "\n",
    "While dataset naming convention might be a little confusing, the simple explanation is that the topic interest model ingests *Firehose* data, and outputs both the *ADAT* and *MasterSurge*.\n"
