## Overview

Bombora has an ever-increasing surface area of client-exposed interfaces, datasets, and services. As our data product suite is further refined, clients desiring to engage on a more technical level require more complete definitions to grok complex concepts.

To ensure we're meeting the needs of such clients, we've created *Bombora Tutorials*: a technical knowledge base of such topics in an format that can easily integrate with modern analysis and development workflows (e.g., versioned datasets, code base and notebooks).

*Bombora Tutorials* leverage [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) an open source notebook format for conveying that has wide industry adoption, and are natively rendered within GitHub. Additionally, we make extensive use of Python, the lingua franca of open source data analysis.

All content here is free (as in speech) for use. Have at it, by all means. :)
